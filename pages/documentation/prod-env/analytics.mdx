Copy both of the values and replace them in your `.env.local` file.

### Replacing Google Analytics ID

Replace `your-google-analytics-id-source-link` with your original `Complete src URL`, and `your-google-analytics-id-value`
with your original `ID Value` from the values provided by the dialog box.

```json filename=".env" copy
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID = your-google-analytics-id-source-link
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID_VALUE = your-google-analytics-id-value
```

</Steps>

Lastly, you can click on the `Test` button to ensure everything has been integrated and is working smoothly.
