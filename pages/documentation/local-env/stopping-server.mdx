## How To Stop StudyStudio?

To stop StudyStudio, Simply pressing `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the server is running would do the trick. In
order to fully stop the server you can also enter the following command to ensure it's completely stopped:

```json filename="terminal" copy
exit
```

This completely stops every running service and now you won't be able to access the application.
